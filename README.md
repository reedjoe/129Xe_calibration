# 129Xe_calibration
A Matlab program for calibrating a 129Xe NMR spectrum of hyperpolarised 129Xe against a 1H spectrum of water.

This program was written as part of my MSci project entitled 'NOVEL LOW-FIELD NMR AND MAGNETOSTATIC FLUX-GATE MAGNETOMETRY TO MEASURE HYPERPOLARISED XENON GAS USED FOR CLINICAL LUNG MRI'. The aim of the program is to determine the degree of polarisation of a sample of hyperpolarised 129Xe gas, which is used in clinical lung MRI. To achieve this, the program compares the 129Xe NMR spectrum to a 1H spectrum of an equivalent sample of water. As the thermal polarisation of water can be calculated from Boltzmann statistics, a calibration factor can be determined by comparing the peak integrals of the two spectra.
